# SESN_tail_slope_fitting
Example code for fitting the tail slope of SESN bolometric luminosity light curves and connecting that slope to progenitor parameters. One jupyter notebook shows how I fit a subset of my SESN simulations for tail slope and the normalization notebook shows how I used to full grid of my simulations to characterize the relationship between tail slope and ejecta mass.
